- 👋 Hi, I’m @TurboOger9000
- 👀 I’m interested in time-traveling vegetable gardens, quantum physics for unicorns, and developing AI to communicate with my pet rock, Steve.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ancient art of llama whispering and how to bake cookies using only the power of the sun and my sheer willpower.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating the world's first interdimensional pizza delivery service and a musical about coding called "JavaScript: The Opera."
- 📫 How to reach me: Send a message in a bottle, attach it to a turtle, and release it into the nearest body of water. Alternatively, try telepathic messages during a full moon.
- 😄 Pronouns: og/er
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once convinced a colony of ants to form a synchronized dance troupe. We almost went on tour, but the ants had scheduling conflicts.
